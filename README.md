# MusicManiac (linux only)

## Description

It's a little graphical interface to manage a big, ordered, detailed discography. Such as Buckethead one.
If you don't know who is Buckethead just go to http://youtube.com !

Some features :

* Supports FLAC and MP3 metadatas : artist, comment, duration, UUID, rating
* Generate M3U playlists with informations based of metadatas
  * One or many artists
  * WITH and WITHOUT keywords (attached to comment metadata)
  * a minimum and maximum duration
  * a minimum rating
* Auto refresh playlist with new musics added
* Some playlist are specials : all.m3u and best.m3u, generated automatically
* FiiO X5 : synchronization script with rsync to export musics listed in all.m3u or best.m3u and all *.m3u files

## How does it work ?

* It scans a directory recursively and read music files supported, and attach an UUID to each one
* Then it reads playlists already generated by MusicManiac and refresh each playlist with musics added or deleted
* When you generate a new playlist, you chose many parameters which will be saved in each playlist.
* Then each music is saved with its UUID, duration, path and name.
* When a playlist is refreshed, the UUID is compared to the one in music metadatas. And you will be warned about missing files.
